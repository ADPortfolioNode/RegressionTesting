# Multiple Linear Regression Model

This Python script demonstrates the use of a multiple linear regression model using several Python libraries.

## Libraries Used

- `matplotlib.pyplot`: Provides a MATLAB-like plotting framework. It is used in this script for data visualization.
- `pandas`: An open-source data manipulation and analysis library. It is used for data manipulation and analysis.
- `pylab`: A module in the matplotlib library. It's used in this script for plotting and potential numerical computations.
- `numpy`: A library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.
- `sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split`: A function to split arrays or matrices into random train and test subsets.
- `sklearn.linear_model`: The module implementing the linear model.
- `sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression`: LinearRegression fits a linear model with coefficients to minimize the residual sum of squares between the observed targets in the dataset, and the targets predicted by the linear approximation.
- `sklearn.metrics.mean_absolute_error`: It measures the average magnitude of the errors in a set of predictions, without considering their direction.

## Installation

To run this script, you need to have Python installed on your system. The required libraries can be installed using pip:

```bash
pip install matplotlib pandas numpy sklearn
